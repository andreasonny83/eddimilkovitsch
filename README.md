The goal is creating a cool website for an Italian artis.
The website must be developed in HTML5 and CSS3. It must be designed for being suitable with a responsive design as well.
In the final work, the user must have the possibility to switch between (at least) two languages (Italian and English).
A gallery will show some mock-ups and photographs of the artist's creations.
